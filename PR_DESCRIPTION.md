# Add auto_apply_to_jobs function to automate job applications

## Description

This pull request adds a new function `auto_apply_to_jobs` to the `candidate_management_system.py` script. The purpose of this function is to automate the application process for a candidate to a list of job listings. The function performs the following tasks:

1. Retrieves the candidate information from the database using the provided `candidate_id`.
2. Iterates through the list of job listings and creates an `Application` instance for each job.
3. Simulates the application submission process (currently a placeholder print statement).
4. Updates the application status to 'Submitted' after the simulated submission.

## Changes

- Added the `auto_apply_to_jobs` function to `candidate_management_system.py`.
- The function handles the creation of `Application` instances and updates their status in the database.

## Follow-up Tasks

- Integrate the `auto_apply_to_jobs` function with the existing job scraping functionality to automatically retrieve job listings.
- Implement the actual application submission process using web automation tools or APIs.
- Add additional error handling for specific cases during the application submission process.
- Thoroughly test the new function with unit tests and integration tests.
- Update the README or other documentation to include information about the new auto-applying functionality and how to use it.

## Testing

The new function has been added, but further testing is required to ensure it works as expected. Unit tests and integration tests should be written to cover various scenarios and edge cases.
