2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - **Description**: Analyze and process job descriptions to extract key information and match job roles with users' skills and experience.
   - **Technologies**: SpaCy, NLTK, TF-IDF Vectorizer, Scikit-learn.
   - **Output**: Processed data with extracted features and job role predictions.

3. **Data Management**
   - **Description**: Store and manage collected job listings and processed data.
   - **Technologies**: Pandas, SQLite (or other lightweight database).
   - **Output**: Database containing job listings and processed data for further analysis and retrieval.

4. **Workflow Automation**
   - **Description**: Automate the job search process, including job listing collection, data processing, and job role matching.
   - **Technologies**: Python scripts, Cron jobs (for scheduling), CI/CD pipeline (for continuous integration and deployment).
   - **Output**: Automated workflows that ensure timely and accurate job search results.

5. **User Interface**
